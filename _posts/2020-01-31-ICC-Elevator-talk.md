# Developing the fluency to speak to a braod audience

# 1. Importance of simplifying
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education ("Making Science Understandable to a Broad Audience", July 23, 1999), it is crucial for success as a professional and in the academy that graduate students develop the ability to give simplified explanations about complex topics and research. There are many situations in which graduate students need to have the ability to simplify and summarize: in teaching, in graduate seminars, at meetings with funders and at conferences, and when interacting, both socially and professionally, with professors and graduate students in other departments.

# 2. Developing your elevator talk
Begin by thinking about the following general questions about your field.\\\\
1. What field do you work in? What are some of the typical goals or purposes that people work towards your field?\\
__I am in Mechanical Engineering. It's a broad field of study in engineering in which people try to understand how energy, force and work is involved in a movement within a system.__

2. Name one major question or problem that many people in your field are trying to solve.\\
__I'm in PHM that stands for Prognostics and Health Management. The overall purpose of PHM is to develop various statistical, physics-based and data-driven methods to predict when a machine, a system or parts is going to stop operating. In short, I am trying to predict how long a machine is going to last before it breaks down.__

# 3. Creating a clear overview
Academic topics often work best when the speaker uses a general-to-specific style of organizing. Start out with statements about the goals of a project before moving into the specific details. This helps the audience understand the ideas more efficiently. Following this three-step pattern can make you easier to understand.\\

1. Tell audience what your main focus area is: "I work in Computational Biology."\\
2. Help your audience understand what one main goal of the focus area is, the one you are trying to help achieve. "One main goal of Computational Biology is to develop models of how cells' behavior changes over microseconds."\\
3. Now, help your understand the details of your project.\\
- "My particular focus is on... "
- "My work focues on... "
- "I'm particularly interested in... "

__I work in Mechanical Engineering, a field of study in engineering in which people study how enery, force and work is involved in any movement within a system. I am particularly interested in developing a data-driven methods to predict how long a machine or parts are going to last before it breaks down and no longer operates.__
