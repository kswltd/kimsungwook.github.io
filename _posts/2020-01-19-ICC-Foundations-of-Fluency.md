# 1. Cross-cultural issues in the classroom:
Understanding some basic differences within the US classroom can help you better compensate for language gaps and deal effectively with CMU students.

- What are some key differences between Teacher-Centered versus Learner-Centered classrooms?
 - Teacher-Centered: students hardly asks any questions to the instructor in authority
 - Learner-Centered: students often lead the lecture and the instructor only suggests some directions
  
- Speaking manner is different in the US
 - Bowling: a player throws the ball one at a time while the rest watches him (e.g. Japan)
 - Basketball: a player does not hold the ball for too long before he passes to another, one often interrupts another in a conversation to say what he knows (e.g. America)
 - Rugby: Conversing with people is more like a battle (e.g. South America)
  - E.g. Columbian guy gets in a business meeting with four Japanese business men.
  
# 2. Understanding the US classroom learning environment:

>> "So, what I had to do in order to become a good TA for American students was adapt myself to the way in the US teachers and TAs are supposed to interact with their students... In my case, I forced myself to start with examples instead of with theory if I speak with American students... If I speak with American students, I always try to use a more practical approach, staring with applications, examples. Even if I think that theory should always come before the application..."

# 3. Robust Teaching Fluency:
An overview of the language skills needed to interact with learners

- To explain Newton's First Law of Motion (A body in motion stays in motion unless acted on by an external force), use these steps:
 - Step 1: Give an example:

 - Step 2: State Newton's Law

 - Step 3: Reword (i.e. Can you say Newton's First Law in another way without using any jargons?)

## My answer:
> When the a moving bus stops suddenly, a person standing inside the bus will want move in the same direction as the bus was moving before it stopped.
