# 1. Introduction
Carnegie Mellon students need to have strong robust fluency in order to handle the demands of interacting in classes and research groups,
working as a TA or carrying out an internship, discussing their research or other complex topics to people outside of their fields (other
academics, students, research funders, etc.); in other words, use English as a professional
  
# 2. Synonyms for 'robust'
- Not brittle
- Sustainable
- Resilient
- Consistent
- Resistant to change

# 3. Robust Fluency includes the ability to:
- Put your knowledge into words
- Give sufficient background information for the audience you are talking to
- Highlight key concepts and phrases
- Link concepts and ideas through transitional language

# 4. Why is this cartoon funny? What are the concepts underlying the humor?

| :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview: What does the explanation focus on?**<br/>The cartoon is funny because of the double meaning of the word positive |
| **Details: What details are needed to support the overview? Which linking phrases should be used?**<br/>The first meaning of positive is a non neutral state / an atom that has lost an electron. The second meaning of positive is being in a good mood |
| **Wrap-up: What do you want the listener to remember about the explanation?**<br/>So the comic is funny because it blends two contrary ideas together / the double meaning is unexpected |

  change the underlying meaning of the headline.
