# 1. Writing Email Requests
Request example:

Subject: Conflict with office hours

Dr.Smith,

This is Josh Brown from your Organic Chemistry class. I was wondering if you could meet with me to talk about Friday's assignment. I am having  trouble with problem 2, and unfortunately, I cannot come to your office hours because I have another class at that time. I know that you are very busy, but would it be possible for you to meet with me at another time? I could meet anytime on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon from 1:30 - 4:30pm.

Thanks,
Josh

Dr. Heart,

This is Joe Adams from your Psych 350 class. I am very sorry for missing Friday's class. I was not feeling well, so I went to the health center. I will get the notes and homework assignment from a classmate, but I was wondering if there is anything else I should do to make up for the work that I missed.

Thanks for your help,
Joe
