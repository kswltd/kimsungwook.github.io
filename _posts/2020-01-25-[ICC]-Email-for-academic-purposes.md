# 1. Writing Email Requests
Request example:

Subject: Conflict with office hours

Dr.Smith,

This is Josh Brown from your Organic Chemistry class. I was wondering if you could meet with me to talk about Friday's assignment. I am having  trouble with problem 2, and unfortunately, I cannot come to your office hours because I have another class at that time. I know that you are very busy, but would it be possible for you to meet with me at another time? I could meet anytime on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon from 1:30 - 4:30pm.

Thanks,
Josh

| :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview: What does the explanation focus on?**<br/>The cartoon is funny because of the double meaning of the word positive |
| **Details: What details are needed to support the overview? Which linking phrases should be used?**<br/>The first meaning of positive is a non neutral state / an atom that has lost an electron. The second meaning of positive is being in a good mood |
| **Wrap-up: What do you want the listener to remember about the explanation?**<br/>So the comic is funny because it blends two contrary ideas together / the double meaning is unexpected |

- Fluency building exercise
  - Each of the following phrases is a newspaper headline. These headlines sound funny because they include "double meanings", which
  change the underlying meaning of the headline.
  
    1. Include Your Children When Baking Cookies
    2. Iraqi Head Seeks Arms
    3. Stolen Painting Found by Tree
    4. Red Tape Holds Up New Bridges
    5. New Study on Obesity Looks for Larger Test Group
    6. Local High School Dropouts Cut in Half
    7. Hospitals Are Sued By 7 Foot Doctors
    8. Police Begin to Run Down Jaywalkers
    9. Drunks Get Nine Months in Violin Case
    
- Exercise: Stolen Painting Found by Tree

| :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview: What does the explanation focus on?**<br/>The chosen headline sounds funny because the word 'by' can be used differently depending on in which context the word is used |
| **Details: What details are needed to support the overview? Which linking phrases should be used?**<br/>The first usage of 'by' is to indicate who found it. In this case, the headline can be interpreted as having a tree that discovered a stolen painting. The second usage of 'by' is to indicate where it was found. People may think a stolen paining was found next to a tree |
| **Wrap-up: What do you want the listener to remember about the explanation?**<br/>So the headline sounds funny because it confuses the readers to think differently about the situation because of the double-meaning of the word 'by' |
