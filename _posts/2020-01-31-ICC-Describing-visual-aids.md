# __"A picture is worth a thousand words."__
Visual aids may include graphs, tables, models, diagrams, flow charts, photographs, illustrations or simple blackboard drawings. They
help to encourage student interest and increase understanding of many concepts. To be effective, visuals should be chosen carefully,
be well-organized, and legible.\\\\

The following are general strategies for explaining a visual aid.
# 1. Specify what the visual represents, its subject
  - This is a graph of...
  - This diagram represents...
  - The table shows the relationship between...

# 2. Give the students an idea of the general layout of the visual
  - The illustration is a cross-section of an apple, showing the stem end on the left and...
  - On this graph, the horizontal axis represents...and the vertical axis represents...
  - The data on this table are presented in descending order...

# 3. Explain the order in which you will discuss the parts of the visual
  - Working from left to right, I will discuss the parts of the cell...
  - We'll look at this from the center and work our way to the outside...
  - Counter-clockwise

# 4. Working in the order you have just discussed, point out the important components and specify their location
  - In the upper left-hand corner of the page we can see...
  - As the illustration shows, in the center of the figure is...
  - Let's look at the first column of this table, which shows...

# 5. Provide conclusions, implications, predictions
  - This graph shows clearly that the population ceases...
  - If this trend continues, we can expect...
  - Looking at this table, we can conclude that...
  
# 6. Provide a transition to the next part of your presentation
  - Now that you have seen the structure of this cell, let's talk about...
  - Moving on to the next part...
  - This table has shown us that...Let's move on now to discuss the implications of this finding...

__This is an illustration that represents how many new international students joined CMU in Summer and Fall semesters in year 2018. The illustration has two visual aids one of which is a table and the other is a pie chart. For the table, the actual numbers of international students as well as the percentages by education are specified on the right side of the table. In case of the pie chart, it shows the relative size of the number of students. This is more intuitive as it is illustrated by the size of different pies depending on the categries which they belong to.__
